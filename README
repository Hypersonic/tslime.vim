This is my fork of tslime.vim. It's better tailored to my use of it, which is to send a command (like 'make') to a tmux pane, rather than the current block of text
I also don't really like having "default" keybinds, so I leave that to you. Bind some key to run the following.
    :call Send_to_Tmux()<CR>
It will ask for the session,window,pane like normal tslime, and then ask for the command you would like to run, which is basically the only divergence this fork has..

Have fun!

==========================================

tslime.vim

This is a simple vim script to send portion of text from a vim buffer to a
running tmux session.

It is based on slime.vim http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/,
but use tmux instead of screen.

However, compared to tmux, screen doesn't have the notion of panes. So, the
script was adapt to take panes into account.

If you use version of tmux < 1.3 , you should use the stable branch. The version
available in that branch isn't aware of panes so it will paste to pane 0 of the
window.
